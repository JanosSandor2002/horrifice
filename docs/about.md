# About the Game

## Horrifice

Horrifice is a 2D pixel art RPG inspired by classics like Final Fantasy IV and Mardek RPG, reimagined through the lens of psychological horror.
Built with the Godot Engine, the game draws its setting and atmosphere from the developer’s own hometown, where every familiar street hides something unsettling beneath its quiet surface.

## Story

In a remote, aging village surrounded by dense forests and endless fog, people whisper about the old cathedral — a monumental structure said to guard catacombs buried deep beneath it.
Legends speak of ancient rituals, forgotten tragedies, and something that was never meant to be unearthed.
When strange phenomena begin to disturb the peaceful life of the village, the player is drawn into uncovering the truth — a truth that may twist their very perception of reality.

## Gameplay

Horrifice features a turn-based combat system reminiscent of Mardek RPG and Final Fantasy IV, where Agility determines the order of actions.
Players can build and customize their party through a skill-based progression system, unlocking new abilities that reflect both their characters’ inner growth and descent into madness.

Outside of battle, exploration and storytelling take center stage — players will traverse the streets of a once-familiar village, uncover hidden passages, piece together cryptic journals, and confront the remnants of what the townsfolk tried so hard to forget.

## Atmosphere & Themes

Horrifice blends nostalgic JRPG design with psychological horror, using pixel art and haunting ambient music to create a sense of decaying beauty.
The world is intimate yet oppressive — every corner of the village tells a story, every sound hints at something lurking beneath.

This is not a tale of heroes saving the world — it’s a descent into the buried sins of a place that should have stayed forgotten.
